# Brick-breaker-game
Brick breaker is an arcade style game. It is a breakout clone in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your paddle. When ever a brick breaks a random good or bad power ups are spawnedâ€¦ which helps the player or make it very hard to win a particular level. The users initially get 3 lives to win a level, if they loose in between any level they have to restart the game from the level one. 
The proposed system is a brick breaker game with more advance features. It has enemies that can destroy the paddle (hence the game will get over). The player will have to be very careful, there are advanced power ups which will help the player to win, but dangerous powers can make it impossible for the user to win the game. This will make the game more interesting and hard which will challenge the user to play. It has 5 different levels each having a different interface and the game gets harder by each passing level.
